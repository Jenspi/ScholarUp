 # :green_apple: ScholarUp Case Study
This case study documents the development process, from initial problem analysis to the final deliverable, highlighting key milestones, stakeholder feedback, and iterative improvements.

## Milestone 2: Problem Analysis and Project Proposal
### Problem Statement
Students struggle with organization, motivation, and consistency in their study habits. Existing apps like Notion, Duolingo, and Quizlet offer partial solutions but lack a unified approach that combines planning, studying, and social accountability.

### Solution: ScholarUp
ScholarUp addresses these challenges by integrating:
- **Study Tools** (Flashcards, Test Maker, Study Timer, Note Imports)
- **Planning** (Task Management, Habit Tracking, Syllabus Integration)
- **Social & Gamification** (Leaderboards, Achievements)

### Stakeholders
1. **Procrastinators** – Need structure and reminders.
2. **Overachievers** – Thrive on competition and achievements.
3. **Freshmen/Transfer Students** – Require guidance and organization.
4. **Non-Traditional Students** – Need accessibility and ease of use.
5. **Students Struggling with Burnout** – Benefit from mindfulness and habit tracking.

### Competitive Analysis
| App | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| ---         |     ---      |          --- |
| Notion   | Organization, Scalability     | Steep learning curve, Poor mobile UX    |
| Duolingo     | Gamification, Addictive       | Aggressive ads, Punitive mistakes      |
| Quizlet     | Study Modes, Offline Access       | Paywalled features, Disorganized imports      |

## Milestone 3: Competitive Analysis
### Inspiration from Existing Apps
1. **Duolingo** – Leaderboards, XP system, addictive UX.

  - **Adopted**: Gamification (but with an opt-out for non-competitive users).
  - **Changed**: Added messaging and customizable themes.

2. **Notion** – Organizational flexibility, templates.
  - **Adopted**: Guided onboarding with tooltips.
  - **Changed**: More intuitive UI with a zen-inspired color scheme.

3. Flora – Study timer with gamified breaks.
  - **Adopted**: Focus timer with breaks.
  - **Changed**: Added doodle feature during breaks for stress relief.

### Conclusion
ScholarUp stands out by merging multiple study tools into one cohesive experience, unlike competitors that focus on single functionalities.

## Milestone 4: Stakeholder Interviews
 - [Stakeholder Questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bmIvVFVsvj_rH24AcGEtTHQtaLRsC4KWJOjmSu54Rr4/edit?usp=sharing)
### Key Insights from User Feedback
| Stakeholder Type | Pain Points | Desired Features |
| ---         |     ---      |          --- |
| Burnt-Out Student   | Overwhelmed, needs breaks     | Mindfulness prompts, habit tracker    |
| Competitive Student     | Wants motivation       | Leaderboards, challenges      |
| Procrastinator     | Hard to start tasks       | Streaks, social accountability      |
| Non-Traditional Student     | Tech learning curve       | Multilingual support, tutorials      |
| Freshman/Transfer Student     | Disorganized       | Syllabus importer, study groups      |

### Synthesis Report Findings
- **Stress Management**: Users wanted built-in relaxation features.
- **Time Management**: Planner with habit tracking was highly requested.
- **Social Motivation**: Study buddies and leaderboards appealed to many.
- **Gamification**: Streaks and achievements kept users engaged.

## Milestone 6: Paper Prototype Testing
### Testing Observations
| Issue  | Solution Implemented |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Unclear navigation icons  | Replaced with labeled sidebar  |
| Hard to find task display  | Added daily/weekly/monthly views  |
| Confusing back buttons  | Made larger and more visible  |

### Key Takeaways from Testing
- Users struggled with icon-based navigation → **Switched to text labels**.
- Task visibility was unclear → **Improved calendar UI**.
- Users loved the color scheme.
- We also observed that students doodle on the white boards, concluding that we also need a doodle feature.

## Final Milestone: Deliverable (Final Features)
### ✅ Study Tools
- Flashcards (create, practice, star difficult cards)
- Test Maker & Mistake Reviewer
- Study Timer (Pomodoro with doodle breaks)

### ✅ Planning
- Task Manager with Due Dates
- Habit Tracker
- Syllabus Importer

### ✅ Social & Gamification

### Impact & Future Improvements
- **Positive Feedback:** Users loved the all-in-one approach.
- **Areas for Improvement:** Stats addition, Leaderboard addition, Test Maker addition. 

### Conclusion
ScholarUp successfully merges planning, studying, and motivation into a single app, addressing key pain points for students. Through iterative testing and stakeholder feedback, the app evolved into a user-friendly, feature-rich tool that enhances study habits while reducing stress.
