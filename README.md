# :green_apple: About ScholarUp
ScholarUp is our study app created for our Mobile Applications Development course in Fall 2023; presented at InnovateUNO (2023) and the Annual ULS Academic Summit (2024).

ScholarUp is a combination of studying, planning, and _friendly_ competition. ScholarUp uses XP from creating flashcards, studying, or mastering a concept to determine where a user would fall on a leaderboard. We implement daily challenges and achievements for those who enjoy the passive challenge.
